* computer choice
this is a function to get computer choice 
it creates a random object between 1 and 3 and assigns 1 to rock, 2 to paper and 3 to scizzors
#+BEGIN_SRC  javascript  :tangle script.js

function getComputerChoice(){
    let computerChoice = Math.floor(Math.random() * (4-1) + 1);
    if (computerChoice == 1){computerChoice = 'rock'}
    else if (computerChoice == 2){computerChoice = 'paper'}
    else {computerChoice = 'scizzor'};
    return computerChoice;

* playing the game 
  it takes two parameters - playerSelection and computerSelection 
  first we convert the player given string to lower case
  then we get a computerSelection by running the getComputerchoice function

  the last part is to compare both 
  now there are three possibilities
** Decision table
  |-----------------+-------------------+---------------------|
  | playerselection | computerselection | result (for player) |
