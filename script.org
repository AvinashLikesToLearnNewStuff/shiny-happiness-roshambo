* computer choice
this is a function to get computer choice 
it creates a random object between 1 and 3 and assigns 1 to rock, 2 to paper and 3 to scizzors
#+BEGIN_SRC  javascript  :tangle script.js

function getComputerChoice(){
    let computerChoice = Math.floor(Math.random() * (4-1) + 1);
    if (computerChoice == 1){computerChoice = 'rock'}
    else if (computerChoice == 2){computerChoice = 'paper'}
    else {computerChoice = 'scizzor'};
    return computerChoice;
}

* playing the game 
  it takes two parameters - playerSelection and computerSelection 
  first we convert the player given string to lower case
  then we get a computerSelection by running the getComputerchoice function

  the last part is to compare both 
  now there are three possibilities
** Decision table 
  |-----------------+-------------------+---------------------|
  | playerselection | computerselection | result (for player) |
  |-----------------+-------------------+---------------------|
  | rock            | rock              | tie                 |
  |                 | paper             | loss                |
  |                 | scizzor           | win                 |
  |-----------------+-------------------+---------------------|
  | paper           | rock              | win                 |
  |                 | paper             | tie                 |
  |                 | scizzor           | loss                |
  |-----------------+-------------------+---------------------|
  | scizzor         | rock              | loss                |

** playRound Function
This function logs who won and returns the result of the round in form of 1, -1 or 0;

 #+BEGIN_SRC  javascript  :tangle script.js
   function playRound(playerSelection, ComputerSelection){
       playerSelection = playerSelection.toLowerCase();  // converting the player string to lower case
       let computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
   //    console.log("player " + playerSelection + " computer " + computerSelection); //this is here for debugging 

       if ( (playerSelection == 'rock' && computerSelection == "scizzor")
	    ||  (playerSelection == 'paper' && computerSelection== "rock") ||
	    (playerSelection == 'scizzor' && computerSelection =="paper")
	  ) {console.log( `You win! ${playerSelection} beats ${computerSelection}`);return 1;}


       else if (
	   (playerSelection == "rock" && computerSelection == "paper")
	       ||  (playerSelection == "paper" && computerSelection== "scizzor") ||
	       (playerSelection == "scizzor" && computerSelection =="rock")
       ) {console.log( `you lose! ${computerSelection} beats ${playerSelection}`); return -1;}

       else {
	   console.log( `it's a tie, you chose ${playerSelection} and the computer chose ${computerSelection} `);return 0;}

* Round Control 
  This is a function that lets us play the game 5 times, it also keeps score and delcares the winner at the end

 Requirements
- make the playe play 5 rounds
- at the end of each round, take input in the form of prompt
- keep score
  How to keep the score?
We can make a separate function that can track player wins and player losses and ties 
if player wins then we can return that as 1, if player loses then we can return that as -1 and it it's a tie, we can return 0 

- declare winner at the end 

** function to play 5 rounds

for round 1 to 5 
    get computer choice
    get input from player
    log the winner or loser
    store the result of each round and keep the score
    display the result at the end 
end 
#+BEGIN_SRC  javascript  :tangle script.js
  function play5Rounds(){
      let playerSelection;
      let playerScore=0;
      let computerScore=0;
      let computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	  console.log(`Round ${i+1}`);
	  computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
	  playerSelection = prompt("enter rock,paper or scizzor");

	  let scoreOfThisRound = playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection);

	  if (scoreOfThisRound == 1){playerScore++;}
	  else if (scoreOfThisRound==-1){computerScore++;}
	  else{}
	  console.log(`playerScore = ${playerScore} and computerScore = ${computerScore}`);   

      }
      whoWon(playerScore, computerScore);
